          <b>Student Bio:</b>
          <br />
          <p>
            Please supply us with a bio of yourself I am a dedicated, creative
            and punctual individual. I have a passion for designing websites and
            creating dynamic programs. I aspire to become a frontend developer.
            I enjoy collaborating with other developers on big projects. I look
            forward to making websites easy for everyone to use and to share my
            knowledge with the developers to come. Please provide us with an
            idea as to where your passion for the tech space came from. I was
            first exposed to a computer in primary school where we learnt basic
            programming and design. This sparked my interest in computers and
            how they work. I continued with computers in high school,
            matriculated and started learning basic HTML and CSS. I created my
            first website when I was 18.
